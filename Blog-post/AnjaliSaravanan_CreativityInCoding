Title: How I Find Joy and Creativity in Coding (or Non-Coding!)
Author: Anjali Saravanan


I have always loved turning data into stories. There’s something inspiring about exploring a dataset, cleaning it up, 
and transforming plain tables and numbers into colorful, meaningful visuals. Designing graphs and charts that reveal 
patterns or insights feels like writing a story—one that sparks curiosity and engages thoughtful conversations with 
stakeholders. Even though cleaning and preprocessing data can be challenging, I’ve learned to see it as an 
essential part of the journey. It helps me truly understand what the data is trying to say.

Over time, I realized that I also find joy in teaching. When I got the opportunity to provide industrial training to 
college students in data analytics, I discovered a new way to express my ideas and share the excitement I feel when 
uncovering insights. It felt rewarding to watch students grow in confidence and skill, and even more fulfilling when 
they reached out to tell me that my sessions helped them land internships and jobs.

It reminded me that creativity doesn’t only exist in the work we do, it also lives in the way we connect, teach, and 
inspire others.
