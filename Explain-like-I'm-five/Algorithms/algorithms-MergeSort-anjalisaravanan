                                Sorting – Organizing chaos (bubbles, merges, and quick ways) 


Imagine you baked a bunch of cookies, but they all came out in different sizes. To sort them from smallest to biggest, 
you start by splitting the big pile into smaller piles — first halves, then quarters — until each pile has just one cookie. 
Each cookie on its own is already sorted.

Next, you start putting two cookies together at a time, always placing the smaller cookie before the bigger one. 
Once you have small sorted pairs, you join these pairs into bigger groups, again checking which cookie is 
smaller and arranging them in order. 

You keep doing this — comparing, merging, and growing your groups — until all the cookies are in one big line, 
perfectly ordered from the tiniest to the largest. 

That’s how merge sort works: you break a big, messy problem into little pieces, sort those small parts, 
and then carefully merge them back together in the right order.
