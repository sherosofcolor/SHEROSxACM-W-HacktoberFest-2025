I wanted my design to look both futuristic and human, to emphasize the juxtaposition of the community of Sheros with the 
technological advancements we contribute to.

The women in the logo are diverse and multicultural, yet all cradle the spark of knowledge. The design of the logo includes 
a circuit-inspired border, as well as an abstract, modern spiral design in the center. 

All of these showcase what Sheros of Color means to me.
